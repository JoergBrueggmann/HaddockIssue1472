remark is a Markdown processor built on micromark powered by plugins part of the unified collective.
Intro

remark is the world's most popular Markdown parser! And it does so much more than parse: it inspects (check, lint) and transforms (generate, compile) Markdown too!

Everything is possible with plugins, such as checking Markdown code style (remark-lint), transforming safely to React (remark-react), adding a table of contents (remark-toc), or compiling to man pages (remark-man).

Internally, remark now uses micromark, a new, fast, and tiny CommonMark compliant Markdown tokenizer. It can be GFM compliant with remark-gfm.

Finally, remark is part of the unified collective. Learn more about us:

Packages

This repository contains the following packages:

    remark-parse - Parse Markdown to syntax trees
    remark-stringify - Serialize syntax trees to Markdown
    remark - Programmatic interface with both remark-parse and remark-stringify
    remark-cli - Command line interface wrapping remark

Security

As Markdown is sometimes used for HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, use of remark can also be unsafe. When going to HTML, use remark in combination with the rehype ecosystem, and use rehype-sanitize to make the tree safe.

Use of remark plugins could also open you up to other attacks. Carefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.
