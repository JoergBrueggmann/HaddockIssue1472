# HaddockIssue1472

This project is just for investigation of tools that have problems with 
    processing the files in here, in particular Haddock.

Background:
In Haddock Issue #1472 is has been reported that Haddock stops processing without any message. It actually hangs.
The problem seems to be related with UTF-8 encoding.
If you remove the character Â© in line 589 of file src/Code.sh then Haddock works as expected.

On windows / mingw systems type sh to execute sh.bat.

On unix-like systems execute the bash skript "sh".
